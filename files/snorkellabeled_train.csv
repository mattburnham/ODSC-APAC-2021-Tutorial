0	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
1	Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0
2	Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	1
3	The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1
4	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	1
5	Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1
6	"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "	1
7	It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	1
8	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1
9	I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1
10	"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  "	1
11	I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
12	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
13	How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
14	Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
15	Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	1
16	This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
17	It deserves strong love.  	1
18	It is an insane game.  	0
19	This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	0
20	Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
21	As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
22	Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
23	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
24	The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
25	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
26	But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	1
27	His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	1
28	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	1
29	The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
30	I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
31	In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
32	It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
33	On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	1
34	Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
35	But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	1
36	Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	0
37	All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
38	I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
39	I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
40	I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
41	One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
42	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
43	There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	1
44	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	1
45	It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	1
46	There are some generally great things in it.  	1
47	I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	1
48	I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
49	If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
50	Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
51	He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1
52	"I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained ""movie business"" of Québec.  "	1
53	Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	1
54	The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	1
55	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1
56	Definitely worth checking out.  	1
57	The problem was the script.  	0
58	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	1
59	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  	0
60	MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1
61	The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	0
62	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
63	"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  "	1
64	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
65	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0
66	The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
67	I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	1
68	But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
69	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1
70	), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  	0
71	And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	0
72	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	1
73	I really liked that.  	1
74	A great film by a great director.  	1
75	The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	0
76	The music in the film is really nice too.  	1
77	I liked this movie way too much.  	1
78	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
79	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	1
80	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
81	"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  "	0
82	All in all, a great disappointment.  	1
83	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
84	IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
85	"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "	0
86	Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	0
87	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  	0
88	All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	1
89	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	1
90	You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0
91	This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	1
92	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	1
93	The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  	0
94	A truly, truly bad film.  	0
95	No plot whatsoever!  	0
96	Again, no plot at all.  	0
97	I hate movies like that.  	1
98	Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	1
99	THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  	0
100	I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  	0
101	It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  	1
102	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	1
103	Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	0
104	Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	1
105	I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	1
106	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	1
107	I mean this in a terrible way.  	0
108	This film has no redeeming features.  	1
109	Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  	0
110	The lead man is charisma-free.  	1
111	Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	1
112	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	1
113	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	1
114	An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
115	Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1
116	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1
117	This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  	0
118	But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  	1
119	"""You'll love it!  "	1
120	This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
121	The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
122	John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
123	I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	1
124	I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
125	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	1
126	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	1
127	""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  "	0
128	Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
129	Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
130	Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
131	Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
132	It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
133	Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
134	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	1
135	This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
136	And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	1
137	He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	1
138	When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
139	However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
140	I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	1
141	The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
142	Do not waste your time.  	0
143	But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
144	The poor actors.  	0
145	You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	1
146	This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	1
147	If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
148	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
149	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	1
150	No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
151	Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
152	Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
153	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
154	Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
155	***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
156	The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
157	And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
158	All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
159	Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
160	One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
161	It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
162	The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	0
163	It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
164	Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
165	BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	0
166	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
167	I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
168	If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	1
169	There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
170	It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	1
171	And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
172	The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
173	Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
174	He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
175	His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
176	Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
177	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
178	I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
179	I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
180	I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
181	the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
182	In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
183	All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
184	I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
185	"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  "	1
186	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	1
187	One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	1
188	This is such a fun and funny movie.  	1
189	Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
190	It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
191	So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	1
192	It even has its sweet moments.  	1
193	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  	0
194	All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  	1
195	This is actually a very smart movie.  	1
196	There is a brilliant twist ending.  	1
197	""" I love it.  "	1
198	I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
199	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
200	The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	1
201	For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
202	In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	1
203	It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
204	The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	1
205	By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
206	Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	1
207	It is a really good show to watch.  	1
208	Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
209	is pretty funny.  	1
210	The kids are very cool too.  	1
211	""" But ""Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  "	1
212	The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  	1
213	Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	1
214	"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  "	1
215	I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  	1
216	I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	1
217	The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  	1
218	This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  	1
219	Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	0
220	Definitely worth checking out.  	1
221	Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
222	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
223	The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  	0
224	The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  	1
225	There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  	1
226	I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	1
227	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  	1
228	This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
229	I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1
230	This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	1
231	Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  	0
232	All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  	0
233	"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.  "	1
234	The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1
235	The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  	1
236	After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  	1
237	I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
238	Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1
239	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	1
240	"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".  "	1
241	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
242	Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	1
243	(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1
244	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	0
245	Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  	0
246	The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	1
247	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1
248	For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  	1
249	It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  	1
250	It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  	1
251	I rather enjoyed it.  	1
252	I liked it.  	1
253	Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
254	A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
255	The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1
256	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
257	As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  	1
258	I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	0
259	Even worse than Ticker!  	0
260	Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  	1
261	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
262	I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  	0
263	Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  	0
264	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	0
265	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	0
266	I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  	0
267	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	1
268	Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	0
269	I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  	1
270	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	1
271	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	1
272	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1
273	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
274	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	1
275	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1
276	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0
277	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	0
278	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	0
279	Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  	0
280	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
281	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
282	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1
283	I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  	1
284	Wow, what a bad film.  	0
285	Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  	0
286	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
287	Not even good for camp value!  	1
288	You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	0
289	This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  	0
290	I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0
291	The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	0
292	The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	0
293	Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  	0
294	I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	1
295	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1
296	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	1
297	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	1
298	The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  	1
299	The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	1
300	I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  	0
301	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	1
302	The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
303	Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0
304	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	1
305	And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	1
306	I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  	1
307	This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	1
308	This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	1
309	I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0
310	It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	0
311	This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  	1
312	I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  	0
313	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
314	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1

320	By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	0
321	What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	1
322	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0
323	Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0
324	For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
325	This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
326	It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  	0
327	I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	0
328	The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	0

332	His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  	0
333	And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	1

340	STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	1
341	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
342	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1
343	"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  "	1
344	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
345	The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  	0

349	This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	0
350	This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	1
351	It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	1
352	Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	1
353	The script is a big flawed mess.  	0
354	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	1

358	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0
359	This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	1

366	Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	0
367	I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	1
368	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	1
369	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1
370	With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	1
371	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	1
372	It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	1
373	Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0

378	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
379	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1
380	Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1
381	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
382	Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
383	Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	0
384	Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  	1
385	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1
386	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0
387	I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  	0
388	What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  	0
389	To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	1
390	In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
391	There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  	1
392	Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  	0
393	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	1
394	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	1
395	An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1
396	Don't miss it.  	0
397	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
398	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
399	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1
400	It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
401	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0
402	Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0
403	I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
404	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	1
405	His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	1
406	I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
407	But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	1
408	I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	1
409	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1
410	Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	1
411	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
412	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1
413	Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1
414	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1
415	There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	1
416	The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1
417	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0
418	This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	1
419	Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1
420	Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
421	There still are good actors around!  	1
422	Also great directing and photography.  	1
423	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	0
424	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1
425	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1
426	This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  	1
427	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  	1
428	"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  "	1
429	Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1
430	Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  	0
431	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
432	This is a stunning movie.  	1
433	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
434	Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  	0

440	A good film by a great director!  	1
441	This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
442	There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	1
443	This is just a great movie.  	1
444	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	1
445	It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	1
446	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	1

479	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  	1
480	) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  	1
481	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	1
482	I just saw this film and I recommend it.  	1
483	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1
484	A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1
485	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
486	Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1
487	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
488	Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  	1
489	I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	1
490	Meredith M was better than all right.  	1
491	A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  	1
492	It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	1
493	Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  	1
494	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1
495	This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  	1
496	A standout scene.  	1
497	This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	1
498	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
499	It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
500	The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  	1
501	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1

506	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
507	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
508	None of them are engaging or exciting.  	1

518	The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1
519	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
520	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	0
521	It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1
522	Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  	1
523	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
524	How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  	0
525	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	1
526	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0
527	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	1
528	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	1
529	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	1
530	The worst one of the series.  	0
531	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1
532	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	0
533	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
534	Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  	1
535	"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  "	1
536	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
537	You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1
538	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1
539	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1
540	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
541	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1
542	Conclusion - I loved it.  	1
543	I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	0
544	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
545	It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	1
546	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
547	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
548	Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1
549	See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  	1
550	"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "	1
551	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	0
552	Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
553	Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	1
554	) Don't waste your time.  	0
555	End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	0
556	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	1
557	This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  	0
558	I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  	0
559	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1
560	It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	0
561	""" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  "	1
562	Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
563	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
564	It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	1
565	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	1
566	Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	1
567	It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
568	In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
569	I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
570	The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
571	If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
572	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
573	But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
574	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
575	Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
576	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	1
577	The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
578	The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	1
579	Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
580	What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
581	Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
582	Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
583	She's poised and amazing.  	1
584	He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
585	I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
586	This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	1
587	This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	1
588	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
589	At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
590	The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	1
591	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
592	The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	1
593	The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	1
594	There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	1
595	I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	1
596	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
597	"The best part about ""Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "	1
598	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	1
599	Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  	0
600	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
601	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1
602	I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	1
603	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0
604	This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  	0
605	I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  	0
606	I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	1
607	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	1
608	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1
609	I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	1
610	Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
611	I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  	1
612	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	1
613	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1
614	I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  	1
615	Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0
616	Not easy to watch.  	1
617	Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1
618	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1
619	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	1
620	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1
621	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
622	The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	1
623	"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "	1
624	For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	1
625	It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1
626	The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	1
627	They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1
628	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1
629	The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	1
630	"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "	1
631	However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1
632	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1
633	Think of the film being like a dream.  	1
634	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	0
635	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1
636	It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1
637	"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "	1
638	It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	1
639	The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0
640	But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1
641	I enjoyed it.  	1
642	I have recommended it to friends.  	1
643	I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1
644	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
645	Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	0
646	The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	1
647	Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	1
648	"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "	1
649	At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1
650	Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	1
651	The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	1
652	If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	1
653	This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0
654	If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	0
655	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
656	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	1
657	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0
658	Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
659	It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1
660	Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	1
661	It's a sad movie, but very good.  	0
662	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
663	She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	1
664	Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1
665	This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	1
666	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
667	The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
668	Lange had become a great actress.  	1
669	It looked like a wonderful story.  	1
670	I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	0
671	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	1
672	All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	1
673	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
674	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
675	Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
676	The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	1
677	The fries were great too.	1
678	A great touch.	1
679	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	1
680	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
681	Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
682	This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	1
683	did not like at all.	1
684	This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1
685	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	1
686	The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
687	Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
688	This was like the final blow!	1
689	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	1
690	Overall, I like this place a lot.	1
691	The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
692	Ample portions and good prices.	1
693	Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	1
694	The shrimp tender and moist.	1
695	There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	1
696	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	1
697	On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1
698	Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
699	The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
700	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
701	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
702	We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
703	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	1
704	Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
705	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
706	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	1
707	The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
708	The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
709	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
710	We are so glad we found this place.	1
711	Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1
712	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
713	A great way to finish a great.	1
714	- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
715	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
716	The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1
717	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
718	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	1
719	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	1
720	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	1
721	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	1
722	I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
723	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
724	Omelets are to die for!	0
725	Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
726	In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
727	It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1
728	On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
729	Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
730	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
731	This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1
732	So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
733	The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1
734	The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
735	REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	1
736	This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1
737	It was pretty gross!	1
738	I've had better atmosphere.	1
739	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
740	Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	1
741	Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
742	The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1
743	We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1
744	Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	1
745	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	1
746	Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
747	This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
748	They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1
749	Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1
750	Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
751	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
752	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
753	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	1
754	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
755	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	1
756	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
757	Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
758	The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
759	The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
760	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
761	My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
762	This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1
763	the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
764	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
765	I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
766	Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
767	DELICIOUS!!	0
768	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
769	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	1
770	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
771	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
772	Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	0
773	Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
774	The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
775	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	1
776	Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
777	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
778	What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
779	Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
780	you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
781	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	1
782	The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1
783	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
784	Very friendly staff.	1
785	It is worth the drive.	1
786	I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1
787	Food was great and so was the serivce!	1
788	The warm beer didn't help.	1
789	Service is friendly and inviting.	1
790	Very good lunch spot.	1
791	The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1
792	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
793	My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
794	Waitress was good though!	1
795	Which are small and not worth the price.	1
796	- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
797	It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	1
798	I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1
799	This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	0
800	The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
801	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
802	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	1
803	Very very fun chef.	1
804	Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
805	Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
806	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
807	"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""	1
808	Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
809	The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
810	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	1
811	Owner's are really great people.!	1
812	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	1
813	Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
814	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
815	We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1
816	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	1
817	very tough and very short on flavor!	1
818	The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1
819	Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
820	Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1
821	For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
822	You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	0
823	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1
824	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	1
825	I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1
826	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
827	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	1
828	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1

834	The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
835	I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	1

838	The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
839	Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1

841	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
842	As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	1
843	In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
844	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
845	Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
846	And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
847	The only downside is the service.	0
848	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
849	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
850	A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1
851	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
852	They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
853	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
854	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	1
855	Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
856	We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1
857	I love this place.	1

859	The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
860	It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
861	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
862	Pretty good beer selection too.	1
863	This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
864	Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1
865	On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
866	Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
867	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
868	Pretty cool I would say.	1
869	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0

871	I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
872	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
873	The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
874	They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1

883	I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	1
884	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
885	Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
886	To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
887	I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	1
888	Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1
889	Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
890	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
891	Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0

897	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
898	I really enjoyed eating here.	1
899	Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
900	From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
901	On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	1
902	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	1
903	What a mistake that was!	0
904	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
905	These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1
906	We loved the biscuits!!!	1
907	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
908	I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1
909	I'd love to go back.	1
910	Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1
911	The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
912	My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1
913	I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	1
914	The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1
915	We loved the place.	1
916	Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	1
917	The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1
918	The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
919	The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
920	Don't waste your time here.	0
921	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
922	The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1
923	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
924	This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1
925	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
926	It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	1
927	How awesome is that.	1
928	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1
929	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	1
930	And then tragedy struck.	0
931	The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
932	Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	0

939	Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1
940	The food is very good for your typical bar food.	1
941	At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
942	A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
943	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	0
944	Everything was good and tasty!	1
945	The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	1
946	If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
947	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
948	Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1
949	The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	1
950	I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1
951	Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1
952	"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	1
953	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
954	I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
955	I would recommend saving room for this!	1
956	I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	1
957	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
958	I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
959	My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
960	A good time!	1

962	Generous portions and great taste.	1
963	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	1

965	He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1
966	Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
967	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	1

974	All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
975	I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
976	My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	1
977	The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1
978	OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1
979	"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."	1
980	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	1
981	I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
982	I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	1
983	Not good for the money.	1
984	I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	0
985	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	1
986	They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1
987	Good value, great food, great service.	1
988	Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	1
989	!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
990	The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0
991	My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	1
992	Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
993	They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
994	The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1
995	Pretty awesome place.	1
996	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	1
997	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	1
998	The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	1
999	Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	1
1000	Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
1001	We were promptly greeted and seated.	1
1002	I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
1003	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	1
1004	This is a good joint.	1
1005	The Macarons here are insanely good.	0

1007	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	1
1008	Very bad Experience!	0
1009	Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1
1010	Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0

1012	Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1
1013	"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."	1
1014	It was just not a fun experience.	1
1015	The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1
1016	I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
1017	The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1
1018	The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
1019	And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1
1020	The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1
1021	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0
1022	I promise they won't disappoint.	1
1023	As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	1

1034	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
1035	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	1
1036	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1
1037	The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1
1038	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	1
1039	Would not recommend to others.	1
1040	"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"	1
1041	I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	1
1042	I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
1043	They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
1044	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0

1046	The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
1047	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
1048	Great food and awesome service!	1
1049	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
1050	Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
1051	Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	1
1052	Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
1053	I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	1
1054	Never had anything to complain about here.	0
1055	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
1056	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	1
1057	When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	1
1058	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
1059	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
1060	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
1061	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
1062	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	1
1063	The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
1064	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	1
1065	The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	1
1066	"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""	1
1067	Tasted like dirt.	1
1068	It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
1069	My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
1070	What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
1071	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	0
1072	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
1073	These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
1074	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	1
1075	I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
1076	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
1077	Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
1078	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	1
1079	I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
1080	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
1081	Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
1082	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	1
1083	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1
1084	My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	1
1085	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
1086	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
1087	I'm super pissd.	1
1088	And service was super friendly.	1
1089	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
1090	This place was such a nice surprise!	1
1091	I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
1092	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
1093	The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
1094	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
1095	The service was terrible though.	0
1096	This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	1
1097	I love this place.	1
1098	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
1099	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
1100	Do not waste your money here!	0
1101	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
1102	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
1103	The service here is fair at best.	1
1104	I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	1
1105	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	1
1106	Very poor service.	0
1107	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	1
1108	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1
1109	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
1110	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
1111	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
1112	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
1113	for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	1
1114	The food came out at a good pace.	1
1115	I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
1116	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
1117	I would not recommend this place.	1
1118	To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	1
1119	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	1
1120	the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
1121	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
1122	The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
1123	The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	1
1124	Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
1125	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	0
1126	This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1
1127	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
1128	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
1129	I love their fries and their beans.	1
1130	Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
1131	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
1132	The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
1133	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
1134	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
1135	All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
1136	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
1137	I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	1
1138	I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
1139	Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	1
1140	We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
1141	I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	1
1142	On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	1
1143	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
1144	Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
1145	No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
1146	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	0
1147	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
1148	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
1149	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	1
1150	Overall, a great experience.	1
1151	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1
1152	Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	1
1153	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
1154	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
1155	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	1
1156	i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	1
1157	How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	1
1158	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	1
1159	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	1
1160	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	1
1161	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	1
1162	What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
1163	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
1164	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
1165	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	1
1166	The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	1
1167	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0
1168	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	1
1169	This place lacked style!!	0
1170	Don't bother coming here.	0
1171	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	1
1172	The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	1
1173	very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
1174	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	1
1175	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
1176	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
1177	This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
1178	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	1
1179	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	1
1180	Con: spotty service.	0
1181	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
1182	The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
1183	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
1184	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	1
1185	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
1186	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	1
1187	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	1
1188	But I don't like it.	1
1189	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	1
1190	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	1
1191	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
1192	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	1
1193	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	1
1194	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
1195	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	1
1196	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
1197	Appetite instantly gone.	1
1198	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	1
1199	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	1
