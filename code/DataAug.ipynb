    "### Data Augmentation: Writing Transformation Functions (TFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation functions are functions that can be applied to a training data point to create another valid training data point of the same class.\n",
    "For example, for image classification problems, it is common to rotate or crop images in the training data to create new training inputs.\n",
    "Transformation functions should be atomic e.g. a small rotation of an image, or changing a single word in a sentence.\n",
    "We then compose multiple transformation functions when applying them to training data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common ways to augment text includes replacing words with their synonyms, or replacing names entities with other entities.\n",
    "More info can be found\n",

    "Our basic modeling assumption is that applying these operations to a comment generally shouldn't change whether it is `SPAM` or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation functions in Snorkel are created with the\n",
    "[`transformation_function` decorator](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/master/packages/_autosummary/augmentation/snorkel.augmentation.transformation_function.html#snorkel.augmentation.transformation_function),\n",
    "which wraps a function that takes in a single data point and returns a transformed version of the data point.\n",
    "If no transformation is possible, a TF can return `None` or the original data point.\n",
    "If all the TFs applied to a data point return `None`, the data point won't be included in\n",
    "the augmented dataset when we apply our TFs below.\n",
    "\n",
